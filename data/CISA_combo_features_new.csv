CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors,"Wed, 09 Aug 2023 19:19:13 +0000","    CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda BackdoorsYou are subscribed to Cybersecurity Advisories for Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. This information has recently been updated, and is now available.CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda BackdoorsUpdated August 9, 2023 CISA has published an additional malware analysis report associated with malicious Barracuda activity. The report provides analysis on four malware samples, including:  WHIRLPOOL – WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server. For more information, including indicators of compromise and YARA rules for detection, see the following malware analysis report: SEASPY and WHIRLPOOL Backdoors MAR-10454006.r4.v2.CLEAR End of update CISA has published three malware analysis reports on malware variants associated with exploitation of  CVE-2023-2868 .  CVE-2023-2868  is a remote command injection vulnerability affecting Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) Appliance, versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006. It was exploited as a zero day as early as October 2022 to gain access to ESG appliances. According to industry reporting, the actors exploited the vulnerability to gain initial access to victim systems and then implanted backdoors to establish and maintain persistence.CISA analyzed backdoor malware variants obtained from an organization that had been compromised by threat actors exploiting the vulnerability.Barracuda Exploit Payload and Backdoor – The payload exploits  CVE-2023-2868 , leading to dropping and execution of a reverse shell backdoor on ESG appliance. The reverse shell establishes communication with the threat actor’s command and control (C2) server, from where it downloads the SEASPY backdoor to the ESG appliance. The actors delivered the payload to the victim via a phishing email with a malicious attachment.SEASPY – SEASPY is a persistent and passive backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda service. SEASPY monitors traffic from the actor’s C2 server. When the right packet sequence is captured, it establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) reverse shell to the C2 server. The shell allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.SUBMARINE – SUBMARINE is a novel persistent backdoor executed with root privileges that lives in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database on the ESG appliance. SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts—including a SQL trigger, shell scripts, and a loaded library for a Linux daemon—that together enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup. CISA also analyzed artifacts related to SUBMARINE that contained the contents of the compromised SQL database. This malware poses a severe threat for lateral movement.For more information, including indicators of compromise and YARA rules for detection, on the exploit payload, SEASPY, and SUBMARINE backdoor, see the following Malware Analysis Reports:Exploit Payload Backdoor MAR-10454006-r3.v1.CLEARSEASPY Backdoor MAR-10454006-r2.v1.CLEARSUBMARINE Backdoor MAR-10454006-r1.v2.CLEARFor more information on  CVE-2023-2868  see, Barracuda’s page Barracuda Email Security Gateway Appliance (ESG) Vulnerability and Mandiant’s blogpost Barracuda ESG Zero-Day Vulnerability ( CVE-2023-2868 ) Exploited Globally by Aggressive and Skilled Actor.To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in these malware analysis reports, contact CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at Report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.",/Users/Jupiter/Desktop/Python_for_Data_Science/ChatGPT4All_good/spam_data/CISA_Releases_Malware_Analysis_Reports_on_Barracuda_Backdoors_5/index.html

SEASPY monitors traffic from the actor’s C2 server. When the right packet sequence is captured, it establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) reverse shell to the C2 server. The shell allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.SUBMARINE – SUBMARINE is a novel persistent backdoor executed with root privileges that lives in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database on the ESG appliance. SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts—including a SQL trigger, shell scripts, and a loaded library for a Linux daemon—that together enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup. CISA also analyzed artifacts related to SUBMARINE that contained the contents of the compromised SQL database. This malware poses a severe threat for lateral movement.For more information, including indicators of compromise and YARA rules for detection, on the exploit payload, SEASPY, and SUBMARINE backdoor, see the following Malware Analysis Reports:Exploit Payload Backdoor MAR-10454006-r3.v1.CLEARSEASPY Backdoor MAR-10454006-r2.v1.CLEARSUBMARINE Backdoor MAR-10454006-r1.v2.CLEARFor more information on  CVE-2023-2868  see, Barracuda’s page Barracuda Email Security Gateway Appliance (ESG) Vulnerability and Mandiant’s blogpost Barracuda ESG Zero-Day Vulnerability ( CVE-2023-2868 ) Exploited Globally by Aggressive and Skilled Actor.To report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in these malware analysis reports, contact CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at Report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.",/Users/Jupiter/Desktop/Python_for_Data_Science/ChatGPT4All_good/spam_data/CISA_Releases_Malware_Analysis_Reports_on_Barracuda_Backdoors_6/index.html

The LockBit Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) attracts affiliates to use LockBit for conducting ransomware attacks, resulting in a large web of unconnected threat actors conducting wildly varying attacks. Affiliates have attacked organizations of various sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit has been successful through its innovation and continual development of the group’s administrative panel (i.e., a simplified, point-and-click interface making ransomware deployment accessible to those with lower degrees of technical skill), affiliate supporting functions, and constant revision of TTPs. CISA and the authoring agencies of this joint CSA encourage the implementation of recommendations provided to proactively improve their organization's defenses against this global ransomware operation, and to reduce the likelihood and impact of future ransomware incidents.",/Users/Jupiter/Desktop/Python_for_Data_Science/ChatGPT4All_good/spam_data/CISA_and_Partners_Release_Joint_Advisory_on_Understanding_Ransomware_Threat_Actors__LockBit/index.html

Visit stopransomware.gov to see all #StopRansomware advisories and to learn more about other ransomware threats and no-cost resources.Actions to take today to mitigate cyber threats from CL0P ransomware: Take an inventory of assets and data, identifying authorized and unauthorized devices and software.Grant admin privileges and access only when necessary, establishing a software allow list that only executes legitimate applications.Monitor network ports, protocols, and services, activating security configurations on network infrastructure devices such as firewalls and routers.Regularly patch and update software and applications to their latest versions, and conduct regular vulnerability assessments.The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint CSA to disseminate known CL0P ransomware IOCs and TTPs identified through FBI investigations as recently as June 2023.According to open source information, beginning on May 27, 2023, CL0P Ransomware Gang, also known as TA505, began exploiting a previously unknown SQL injection vulnerability ( CVE-2023-34362 ) in Progress Software's managed file transfer (MFT) solution known as MOVEit Transfer. Internet-facing MOVEit Transfer web applications were infected with a web shell named LEMURLOOT, which was then used to steal data from underlying MOVEit Transfer databases. In similar spates of activity, TA505 conducted zero-day-exploit-driven campaigns against Accellion File Transfer Appliance (FTA) devices in 2020 and 2021, and Fortra/Linoma GoAnywhere MFT servers in early 2023.FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of CL0P ransomware and other ransomware incidents.Download the PDF version of this report:AA23-158A #StopRansomware: CL0P Ransomware Gang Exploits  CVE-2023-34362  MOVEit Vulnerability (PDF, 661.57 KB )TECHNICAL DETAILSNote: This advisory uses the MITRE ATT&CK® for Enterprise framework, version 13. See MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise for all referenced tactics and techniques.Appearing in February 2019, and evolving from the CryptoMix ransomware variant, CL0P was leveraged as a Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) in large-scale spear-phishing campaigns that used a verified and digitally signed binary to bypass system defenses. CL0P was previously known for its use of the “double extortion” tactic of stealing and encrypting victim data, refusing to restore victim access and publishing exfiltrated data on Tor via the CL0P^_-LEAKS website. In 2019, TA505 actors leveraged CL0P ransomware as the final payload of a phishing campaign involving a macro-enabled document that used a Get2 malware dropper for downloading SDBot and FlawedGrace. In recent campaigns beginning 2021, CL0P preferred to rely mostly on data exfiltration over encryption.Beyond CL0P ransomware, TA505 is known for frequently changing malware and driving global trends in criminal malware distribution. Considered to be one of the largest phishing and malspam distributors worldwide, TA505 is estimated to have compromised more than 3,000 U.S.-based organizations and 8,000 global organizations.TA505 has operated:A RaaS and has acted as an affiliate of other RaaS operations,As an initial access broker (IAB), selling access to compromised corporate networks,As a customer of other IABs,And as a large botnet operator specializing in financial fraud and phishing attacks.In a campaign from 2020 to 2021, TA505 used several zero-day exploits to install a web shell named DEWMODE on internet-facing Accellion FTA servers. Similarly, the recent exploitation of MOVEit Transfer, a SQL injection vulnerability was used to install the web shell, which enabled TA505 to execute operating system commands on the infected server and steal data.In late January 2023, the CL0P ransomware group launched a campaign using a zero-day vulnerability, now catalogued as  CVE-2023-0669 , to target the GoAnywhere MFT platform. The group claimed to have exfiltrated data from the GoAnywhere MFT platform that impacted approximately 130 victims over the course of 10 d",/Users/Jupiter/Desktop/Python_for_Data_Science/ChatGPT4All_good/spam_data/_StopRansomware__CL0P_Ransomware_Gang_Exploits_CVE_2023_34362_MOVEit_Vulnerability/index.html

This enables the cyber actor to blend in with routine Windows system and network activities, limit activity and data captured in default logging configurations, and avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR) products that could alert to the introduction of third-party applications on the host or network. Private sector partners have identified that this activity affects networks across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, and the authoring agencies believe the actor could apply the same techniques against these and other sectors worldwide.The authoring agencies have identified potential indicators associated with these techniques. To hunt for this activity, CISA and partners encourage network defenders to use the actor’s commands and detection signatures provided in this advisory. CISA and partners further encourage network defenders to view the indicators of compromise (IOCs) and mitigations summaries to detect this activity. ",/Users/Jupiter/Desktop/Python_for_Data_Science/ChatGPT4All_good/spam_data/CISA_and_Partners_Release_Cybersecurity_Advisory_Guidance_detailing_PRC_state_sponsored_actors_evading_detection_by__Living_off_the_Land_/index.html

With pre-ransomware notifications, organizations can receive early warning and potentially evict threat actors before they can encrypt and hold critical data and systems for ransom. Using this proactive cyber defense capability, CISA has notified more than 60 entities of early-stage ransomware intrusions since January 2023, including critical infrastructure organizations in the Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Water and Wastewater Systems sectors, as well as the education community.The pre-encryption ransomware notification was cultivated with the help of the cybersecurity research community and through CISA’s relationships with infrastructure providers and cyber threat intelligence companies.For more information, visit #StopRansomware. To report early-stage ransomware activity, visit Report Ransomware. CISA also encourages stakeholders and network defenders to review associate director Romans’ post, Getting Ahead of the Ransomware Epidemic: CISA’s Pre-Ransomware Notifications Help Organizations Stop Attacks Before Damage Occurs, to learn more about CISA’s Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative.Please share your thoughts.

The MITRE ATT&CK® framework is a lens through which network defenders can analyze adversary behavior and, as CISA Executive Assistant Director Eric Goldstein noted in his June 2021 blog post on the framework, it directly supports “robust, contextual bi-directional sharing of information to help strengthen the security of our systems, networks, and data.” CISA highly encourages the cybersecurity community to use the framework because it provides a common language for threat actor analysis.CISA coordinated this update of the best practices with the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute™ (HSSEDI), a DHS-owned R&D center operated by MITRE. The update covers changes that the MITRE ATT&CK team made to the framework since CISA initially published the best practices in June 2021. The update also covers common analytical biases, mapping mistakes, and specific ATT&CK mapping guidance for industrial control systems (ICS). ",/Users/Jupiter/Desktop/Python_for_Data_Science/ChatGPT4All_good/spam_data/CISA_Updates_Best_Practices_for_Mapping_to_MITRE_ATT_amp_CK_/index.html

The `parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including version `2.2.1` does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`, allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype, which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution. However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have significant security impact for an application if the object is later used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from `JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse` should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse` to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in json5 version 2.2.2 and later.2022-12-248.8 CVE-2022-46175 MISCMISCMISCampache -- ampacheUnrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type in GitHub repository ampache/ampache prior to 5.5.6.2022-12-238.8 CVE-2022-4665 CONFIRMMISCusememos -- memosImproper Access Control in GitHub repository usememos/memos prior to 0.9.0.2022-12-238.8 CVE-2022-4684 CONFIRMMISCusememos -- memosImproper Authorization in GitHub repository usememos/memos prior to 0.9.0.2022-12-238.8 CVE-2022-4688 CONFIRMMISCusememos -- memosImproper Access Control in GitHub repository usememos/memos prior to 0.9.0.2022-12-238.8 CVE-2022-4689 CONFIRMMISClinux -- linux_kernelAn issue was discovered in ksmbd in the Linux kernel 5.15 through 5.19 before 5.19.2.
