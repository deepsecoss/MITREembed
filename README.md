# MITREembed
Map MITRE attack to n-dimensional embeddings and vise-versa.

While there are many projects that are looking at SIGMA, Splunk, Snort IDS rule, yaml, python, etc wriring and mapping to MITRE:
a) they could probably benefit from more visibility
b) they do not then map to a deep learning-based anomaly detection

The trick here is that presumably every deep learning-based anomaly detection will flag anomalies differently.  How should we address this?

This project serves as an enhancement or context provider of ML or AI output in weight or nominal form (like a score) to be translated to english text with conext - like mapping to a MITRE technique.
